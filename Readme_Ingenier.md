# COMPLEXUS PROJECT

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

**COMPLEXUS** is a private social network designed for owners of residential complexes. The primary goal is to develop a web platform that enables residents to access relevant and up-to-date information about events and activities within their community. Additionally, the platform will facilitate interaction and communication between owners and administrators, who will manage posts and user access.

## STAKEHOLDERS

### INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS

The success of the COMPLEXUS project relies on the collaborative efforts of a specialized development team, consisting of:

- **Backend Developers (3):** Responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining a robust and secure database capable of efficiently handling large volumes of information, with high scalability and adherence to strict security standards.

- **Frontend Developers (2):** In charge of creating an intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing user interface that offers an optimized and smooth user experience. Developers should be familiar with concepts such as pagination, layout, and user-centered design, utilizing modern and adaptive technologies.

### EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS

The target audience for COMPLEXUS includes:

- **Residential Complex Owners (houses, apartments, buildings, etc.):** End users who will access the platform to obtain information about the residential complex, interact with other owners, and participate in community life.

- **Residential Complex Administrators:** Key figures in platform management, responsible for posting announcements, moderating interactions, and managing user permissions to ensure a controlled and relevant information flow.

## GENERAL OBJECTIVE

**Develop a web platform that enhances internal communication between owners and the administration of a residential complex, providing a secure and efficient environment for managing community information.**

## SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

- **Foster interaction among owners within the residential complex.**
- **Optimize the management experience for administrators through the use of advanced technologies.**
- **Facilitate effective communication between administration and owners, ensuring the delivery of accurate and timely information.**

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **User Login:**
   - Users (owners and administrators) must authenticate via a secure login form. The system should manage differentiated roles, assigning permissions and access based on the user type (owner or administrator).

2. **Owner Registration:**
   - Owners must complete a registration form requesting relevant personal information (name, phone number, property number, residential complex, code provided by the administrator). Only users belonging to the residential complex will be able to access the system.

3. **Administrator Registration:**
   - Administrators will register their residential complex through a form collecting specific data (name, phone number, ID number, residential complex to be managed). They will subsequently authorize owners to access the system.

4. **User Profile - Owner:**
   - The owner profile will include access to complex posts, allowing for the creation, editing, and deletion of posts. Owners can also view posts pinned by the administrator and update their profile information.

5. **User Profile - Administrator:**
   - Administrators will have extensive control over the platform, with the ability to moderate, edit, and delete posts from both owners and themselves. They can pin important posts for priority, manage the status of owners (active or inactive), and activate or remove users as needed.

## NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Security:**
   - The platform must adhere to high security standards, protecting users' personal data with secure authentication, encryption of sensitive data, and role-based access control.

2. **Scalability:**
   - The system must be designed for scalability, supporting multiple residential complexes and increasing numbers of users without affecting performance.

3. **Usability:**
   - The interface should be intuitive, accessible, and responsive across various devices, ensuring a smooth user experience.

4. **Maintenance and Updates:**
   - The system architecture should allow for easy implementation of improvements and updates without disrupting service.

5. **Performance:**
   - The system must provide efficient response times and handle multiple concurrent requests without impacting user experience.
